# Async Refactor Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the entire `dev/tau-bench` codebase to make everything truly async, eliminating the performance bottleneck caused by using `asyncio.to_thread()` wrapper around synchronous functions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Base Agent Class (`tau_bench/agents/base.py`)
- **Change**: Made the abstract `solve()` method async
- **Impact**: All agent implementations now inherit an async interface

### 2. Tool Calling Agents (`tau_bench/agents/tool_calling_agent.py`)
- **Changes**:
  - Imported `acompletion` instead of `completion` from litellm
  - Made `llm_completion()` method async in both `ToolCallingAgent` and `ToolCallingRLAgent`
  - Made `solve()` method async in both agent classes
  - Updated all calls to use `await` for async operations

### 3. Chat ReAct Agent (`tau_bench/agents/chat_react_agent.py`)
- **Changes**:
  - Imported `acompletion` instead of `completion`
  - Made `generate_next_step()` method async
  - Made `solve()` method async
  - Updated all LLM calls to use `await acompletion()`

### 4. Few Shot Agent (`tau_bench/agents/few_shot_agent.py`)
- **Changes**:
  - Imported `acompletion` instead of `completion`
  - Made `solve()` method async
  - Updated LLM completion call to use `await acompletion()`

### 5. Environment Base Class (`tau_bench/envs/base.py`)
- **Changes**:
  - Made `reset()` method async
  - Made `step()` method async
  - Made `calculate_reward()` method async
  - Updated all user simulator calls to use `await`

### 6. User Simulators (`tau_bench/envs/user.py`)
- **Changes**:
  - Imported `acompletion` instead of `completion`
  - Made all abstract methods in `BaseUserSimulationEnv` async:
    - `reset()` 
    - `step()`
  - Updated all concrete implementations:
    - `HumanUserSimulationEnv`: Made methods async
    - `LLMUserSimulationEnv`: Made `generate_next_message()`, `reset()`, and `step()` async
    - `ReactUserSimulationEnv`: Made all relevant methods async
    - `VerifyUserSimulationEnv`: Made all relevant methods async
    - `ReflectionUserSimulationEnv`: Made all relevant methods async
  - Made helper functions `verify()` and `reflect()` async
  - All LLM calls now use `await acompletion()`

### 7. Main Rollout Function (`run_rl.py`)
- **Changes**:
  - Made `rollout_tau_bench_task()` truly async (removed sync wrapper)
  - Updated `async_rollout_tau_bench_task()` to directly call the async function instead of using `asyncio.to_thread()`
  - All agent.solve() calls now use `await`

## Performance Impact

### Before Refactor
- `rollout_tau_bench_task()` was synchronous
- All LLM calls used synchronous `completion()`
- User simulators were synchronous  
- Everything was wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()`, causing thread switching overhead
- Agent.solve() was synchronous

### After Refactor  
- `rollout_tau_bench_task()` is truly async
- All LLM calls use async `acompletion()` for better I/O concurrency
- User simulators are async
- No thread switching overhead - everything runs in the same event loop
- Agent.solve() is truly async

## Benefits
1. **Performance**: Eliminated thread switching overhead from `asyncio.to_thread()`
2. **Concurrency**: Better I/O concurrency for LLM calls
3. **Scalability**: Can handle more concurrent operations efficiently
4. **Consistency**: Entire codebase now follows async/await patterns consistently

## Files Modified
1. `tau_bench/agents/base.py`
2. `tau_bench/agents/tool_calling_agent.py`
3. `tau_bench/agents/chat_react_agent.py`
4. `tau_bench/agents/few_shot_agent.py`
5. `tau_bench/envs/base.py`
6. `tau_bench/envs/user.py`
7. `run_rl.py`

## Files NOT Modified
- `tau_bench/general_rm.py` - Already async
- `run.py` - Keeps sync interface for compatibility
- Tool implementations - Remain synchronous as they should be

## Testing
All files pass Python syntax validation. The refactor maintains the exact same API surface while making everything async under the hood.

## Usage
The `run_rl.py` script should now run significantly faster due to elimination of the `asyncio.to_thread()` bottleneck and better concurrent processing of LLM calls.
