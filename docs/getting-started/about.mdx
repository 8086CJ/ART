Greetings fellow artisans! At OpenPipe, our mission is to provide the training tools **small teams** need to achieve SOTA performance at specific tasks.

**ART** (Agent Reinforcement Trainer) is an open-source training framework for teaching agentic LLMs to improve **performance** and **reliability** through **experience**. ART provides a convenient wrapper around reinforcement learning techniques like **GRPO** (Group Relative Policy Optimization) to dramatically improve model performance while minimizing training costs.
